#' Write a `QFeatures` object to an .h5mu file.
#'
#' Inverse of `readLinkH5MU()`. `MuData::writeH5MU()` covers the
#' MultiAssayExperiment skeleton; the feature graph held in `AssayLinks` has no
#' place there, so it is written separately to the global `.varp` as a `p x p`
#' sparse adjacency matrix over the global `.var` index.
#'
#' Assays that are *sample blocks* of another assay — scp's one-assay-per-MS-run
#' layout, later merged by `joinAssays()` — are collapsed into the assay they
#' join into rather than written as modalities of their own; see
#' `sample_blocks()` for the rule and what went wrong without it.
#'
#' Two parts of the specification are deliberately not implemented here and are
#' tracked separately in ROADMAP.md:
#'
#'   * The layer half of the modality/layer split. A one-to-one transformation on
#'     *identical* rows and columns, such as `logTransform()`, still becomes a
#'     second modality plus an edge rather than a layer of its parent. Only the
#'     sample-block half of the rule is implemented.
#'   * `uns["mulink"]["assays"]`, which records `AssayLink@fcol` and which layer
#'     an inter-modality edge starts from. `fcol` therefore does not survive this
#'     write, and `readLinkH5MU()` substitutes the `.varp` key for it. It is also
#'     what a reader would need to split the collapsed blocks back out, so this
#'     write is lossy for them: `readLinkH5MU()` returns the joined assays only.
#'
#'
#' @param object A `QFeatures` object.
#' @param path Path of the .h5mu file to create.
#' @param feature_mapping_key Key to store the feature graph under in `.varp`.
#' @param prefix,sep Passed to `feature_index()`.
#' @param overwrite Whether to replace `path` if it already exists.
#'
#' @return `path`, invisibly.
